    <h2>Assembling the Flute and how to Place Your Fingers</h2>
    <p>We are using a C flute here. The flute has three parts: the head joint, the body, and the foot joint. This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJ84L_O51zc">video</a> shows you how to assemble a flute. To see how to place your fingers on a flute, click <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INMsFBv-iAo">here</a>.</p>
    
    <h2>Fingering Chart</h2>
    <p>This <a href="https://www.amromusic.com/flute-fingering-chart">website</a> shows the notes and the fingering that corresponds to each note.</p>
    
    <h2>How to Play</h2>
    <p>You can start learning how to make a sound on a flute by using just the head joint first. Put your lips on the plate. Do not cover the hole. To get the right embouchure, you say "mmm" and then "pu". Keep blowing while turning the head joint to find your perfect spot. In this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYdH6U_gClY">video</a>, the teacher teaches how to make a sound by using a head joint, how the embouchure should be like, and how to tongue. You should also learn how to tune. Tuning is important because you want to know if you are playing at the right pitch. You can use an online tuner <a href="https://www.flutetunes.com/tuner/">here</a> or buy one yourself.</p>
