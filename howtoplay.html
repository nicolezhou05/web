    <h2>How to Play</h2>
    <p>You can start learning how to make a sound on a flute by using just the head joint first. Hold the head joint horizontally with the cap/crown facing your left and the hole at the end of the head joint facing your right. Put your lips on the plate. Do not cover the hole. To get the right embouchure, you say "mmm" and then "pu". Keep blowing while turning the head joint to find your perfect spot. Once you made a sound, you can assemble your flute and start playing! Remember to clean your flute with a soft cloth after you are done playing in order to keep your flute in good condition.</p>
    <p>In this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYdH6U_gClY">video</a>, the teacher teaches how to make a sound by using a head joint, how the embouchure should be like, and how to tongue.</p>
    <p>You should also learn how to tune. Tuning is important because you want to know if you are playing at the right pitch. You can use an online tuner <a href="https://www.flutetunes.com/tuner/">here</a> or buy one yourself.</p>
