    <h2>Assembling the Flute and How to Place your Fingers</h2>
    <p>The flute has three parts: the head joint, the body, and the foot joint. The head joint and the foot joint should be assembled to the two ends of the body joint. When assembling, you should twist the flute parts together gently. Try not to use too much force. This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJ84L_O51zc">video</a> shows you how to assemble a flute correctly. Also, keep in mind that when you open and close the flute case, you should do it properly and carefully because you wouldn't want to damage your flute.</p>
