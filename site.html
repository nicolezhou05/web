    <h1>How to Play the Flute</h1>
    
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Flutes are musical instruments that belong to the woodwind family. Unlike most instruments in the woodwind family, reeds are not needed to play the flute. Instead, you just have to blow through the hole located on the head joint.</p>
    <p>There are many different types of flutes. The common types of flutes are the piccolo and the C flute, which we will be talking about. In this website, you will learn how to assemble a flute, where to place your fingers on the flute, and how to play. You can also check out the fingering chart for the different notes and some easy pieces to start with.</p>
